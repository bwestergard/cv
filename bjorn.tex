	\begin{itemize*}
		\item Currently developing a Node/Backbone petition application that contacts all of one's elected representatives in a single step with only a provided address. Message delivery by browser emulation and email scales with RabbitMQ and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
		\item Proposed and prototyped political supporter identity matching API built atop a Neo4j graph database, now in production.
    \item Wrote ``supercookie'' service using Node/MongoDB to retain user information across domains, dramatically improving conversion rates and providing a comprehensive view of supporter engagement.
		\item Developed Drupal-based Social Organizing application, through which supporters can match Facebook friends to the national voter file, information used by clients for micro-targeting. Forked codebase to experiment with shifting business logic to the client side, an approach subsequently adopted by the team.
		\item Products contributed to are in use by hundreds of Democratic Party, AFL-CIO, and non-profit campaigns, scaling to election season loads by means of Amazon's cloud offerings (particularly EC2, S3, DynamoDB, SQS). Work was carried out in teams of two to five following a SCRUM process with extensive automated testing, with each developer contributing to the full stack.

	\begin{itemize*}
		\item Worked on shop floor with engineers and mechanics to develop a software dashboard to visualize and log measurements taken with the company's bespoke engine test apparatus (dynamometric).
		\item Visualizations implemented with Java (Processing.org libraries). Made modifications to a Python driver for real-time instrumentation readings.
