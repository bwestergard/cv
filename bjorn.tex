	      \begin{itemize*}
	      \item Worked with another engineer to design and implement a new podcast listenership data pipeline that could handle an order of magnitude increase in download volume. Built around Druid (a timeseries database), we also made extensive use of Terraform, Google Dataflow (Apache Beam, Java), and Cloud Functions (Node).
              \item Developed and implemented a method for forecasting podcast downloads by demographic and geographic segment using historical data from aforesaid pipeline, enabling users to estimate advertising inventory months in advance (Node, Flow, Postgres).   
              \item Forked the open source Turnilo project (Typescript) to integrate it with our Ruby on Rails application by means of JSON Web Tokens, such that users could run arbitrary Druid queries within those subsets of the data they were authorized to view.
                \item Added features to our Ruby on Rails application with React and gave brownbag talks on JavaScript best practices.

					\item Named as first inventor on a patent application drafted by Lanetix, Inc. in connection with this work, \textit{Systems and Methods for Data Translation between Non-Homogenous Datastores}.

	      	\item Sole engineer working alongside founders to implement unified inventory, e-commerce, and delivery system with Node, React, Postgres (PostGIS). This system freed the management team to experiment with different delivery mechanisms within and between cities as the business grew.
	      	\item Surveyed academic literature and collaborated with distribution staff to write software suited to the unique operational challenge of offering same-day delivery of a highly perishable good (bouquets).
